    "**Project: Twentieth-Century Key Events NER Analysis**\n",
    "During the initial evaluation of the scraped twentieth-century text file, several \"dirty\" data issues were identified that could interfere with the Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm. Below are the specific observations and the corrective actions taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔍 Initial Observations**\n",
    "Whitespace and Line Breaks: The raw text contained numerous \\n (newline) characters. In NLP, these can prematurely break a sentence, causing the algorithm to miss relationships between countries that span across a line break.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Citation Markers**: Because the data was scraped, it contained Wikipedia-style citations (e.g., [1], [15]). These are problematic because the NER algorithm might try to process them as part of a word or a \"Work of Art\" entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Characters**: Unexpected symbols and non-standard spacing were present, which can confuse the Tokenization step of the NLP process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entity Inconsistency**: Some countries were referred to by multiple names (e.g., \"U.S.A.\" vs \"United States\"). These must be standardized to match the countries_lookup.txt list exactly for the filtering step to work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🛠️ Cleaning Steps Taken**\n",
    "Removing Line Breaks: I used the .replace('\\n', ' ') method to turn all hard returns into single spaces, creating a continuous flow of text for better sentence segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Removing Citations**: I utilized the re (Regular Expression) library to identify and remove any digits inside square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern used: r'\\[\\d+\\]'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardizing Country Names**: I performed a manual check against my country list and used string replacement to ensure that country names in the text (Source) match the names in my lookup dictionary (Reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding Check**: The file was saved using UTF-8 encoding to ensure that any special characters or accented names (like \"Côte d'Ivoire\") are preserved correctly without turning into garbage text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Final Result**\n",
    "The cleaned text is now a \"Sequence of Tokens\" ready to be converted into a spaCy Doc object. By removing the \"noise\" (citations and line breaks), the Dependency Parsing step can now accurately look at the tokens in their specific context."
